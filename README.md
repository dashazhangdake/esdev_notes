# Experimental materials for ESdev Labs
**Warnings**: 
* This is an experimental repo for esdev course
* It's just an additional reference for those who are intersted in both Python and C (or some HDLs), or want to use *(arguably)* more readable lab documents.

**Description:**
* Concepts related to lab3 - lab6 are important and also useful for many other programming languages. 
I hope these Python materials could be helpful for your projects.

**Dependencies:**
* Conda environment is highly recommended
* Jupyter notebook for Python3
* Jupyter notebook for C++ ([Cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling))

**Note:**
* These note book is just for your reference. Though I will make these code snippe produce reasonable outputs. I cannot guarantee the correctnes of the contents.
* Also, you cannot use Python for regular Labs (Except for the last Python lab). You have to use C

Any contributions to this repo are welcomed
