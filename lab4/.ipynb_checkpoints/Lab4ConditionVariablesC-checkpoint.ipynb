    "## 1.1. Background\n",
    "Mututexes are great for locking things 'away' (so that **only one thread** can **access** them at a time), but they are not sufficient for more complex synchronization schemes where **a thread is expected to wait for a condition to become true**. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is, mutexes are not good for cooperating threads that want simply inform each other about something important. This problem is handled by **condition variables** in the pthreads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Definition\n",
    "A **conditional variable** is a kind of synchronization object that a thread can **wait for a condition to become true**. A condition variable is always associated with a **mutex**. The **mutex** is required for a condition variable to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "A thread may wait on a **condition variable** only inside of a **critical section** that is protected by the **mutex** associated with the condition variable. \n",
    "* Before blocking on a condition variable, a thread must **aquire (lock)** the the associated mutex. \n",
    "* When a thread blocks on a condition variable, the associated mutex is **released (unlocked)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a thread blocked on a **condition variable** is woken up, pthread takes the following action:\n",
    "* To **wake up** a thread ```t1``` blocked on a condition, a thread ```t2``` must **lock** the associated **mutex** first.\n",
    "* Then ```t1``` is **unlocked and inserted** to the mutex queue. \n",
    "* When ```t2``` will **unlock** the mutex, ```t1``` will eventually compete for it with other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that When ```t1``` is woken up and lock the mutex again, the **condition** might be **False** again\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/ex_cond1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 640px;\"/>\n",
    "**The solution** is that ```t``` **must** test the condition again, block if needed"
