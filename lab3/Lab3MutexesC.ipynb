    "## 1.1. Terms\n",
    "**Mutex** stands for \"mutual exclusion semaphore\", which indicates they are good for ensuring **mutual exclusion** between threads when accessing shared resources. Mutexes are similiar to **binary semaphores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that all threads running in a process share the resources of that process: memory, files, etc. \n",
    "Consider the case when two threads need a shared resource (like a serial port) to perform some action (e.g. send messages in sequences of bytes). We don't want to get the bytes of the messages mixed up coming from the two threads, so this **resource** needs to be under **\"mutual exclusion\"**: \n",
    "* **Only one thread** can access it while sending a complete message. \n",
    "* We call the section of the code accessing the shared resources a **\"critical section\"**. Two or more threads cannot excecute in the critical simultaneously\n",
    "* **At most** one thread is permitted to execute that critical section at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Mutex States\n",
    "A mutex has two states: locked an unlocked. It can be considered as a binary counter, that can be either \n",
    "* **0 (locked)**: when entering the critical section\n",
    "* **1(unlocked)**: when exiting the critical section\n",
    "One can think of two operations to protect the critical section\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Semantics\n",
    "* ```lock(m)```: \n",
    "    * If mutex ```m``` is unclocked (counter = 1), lock it (decrease the counter to 0). \n",
    "    * If the mutex is locked (counter = 0), block until ```m``` is unlocked.\n",
    "* ```unlock(m)```: \n",
    "    * If mutex ```m``` is unlocked (counter = 1), error\n",
    "    * If mutex is locked (counter = 0), unlock it (increase the counter) and wake up blocked threads\n",
    "    \n",
    "The mutex must be:\n",
    "* **locked** to **aquire a shared resource** (entering the critical section) before **accessing** it\n",
    "* **unlocked** when the access to the shared resource is **terminated**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4. Semaphore vs. Mutex\n",
    "While a semaphore provides generic synchornization because of the semaphpre can be initialized to a generic value, a mutex explictly provides the concept of **critical section** (they can be **ONLY** used for mutal exclusion). \n",
    "\n",
    "The mutex counter is always automatically initialized to 1, and the mutex can be unlocked only by the thread that locked it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutexes are less powerful than (general purpose) semaphores, but can help preventing program errors."
